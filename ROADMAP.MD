# TO-DO LIST / WORK IN PROGRESS
Status of things to implement and what will be implemented (if no big roadblock in implementing things) and implementations dropped 

## TO-DO LIST : Things to Implement

 - Hardware:
	 - ESP32 Base block
	 - Serial Interface and programming / boot block
	 - Power Block
	 - Mosfet control block
	 - Thermal Block
	 - EndStop block
	 - SD card Block
	 - LCD Block
	 - Drive Block
	 - Input Block
	 - Output Block
	 - Expansion Block (adding multiple ADC inputs / PWM outputs / and extra (non-critical) I/Os
 - Software (Marlin capabilities)
	 - To be defined and refined later(Working on reading the documentation and the 2.1.2.4 codebase)
 - Software (Not supported in Marlin as of 2.1.2.4) to code and pull to marlin
	 - Baseboard file and configurations file
	 - Support for SPI or I2C multichannel ADC / PWM and IO Expander ICs for noncritical inputs and outputs like temperature readings, led and fan control,

## TO-DO LIST : Things already Implemented

 - None

## TO-DO LIST : Implementations Dropped 

 - None as of today
## Work in Progress

 - Generic schematic: 
	 - Making the base schematic with standard components for minimal 3D printing
